A simple yet intelligent rule-based chatbot built using Python.
It can greet you, tell jokes, show the current date or time, perform simple math, and engage in basic conversation.

🧠 Overview

This chatbot works on a rule-based system — it uses predefined patterns (if-elif conditions) to detect keywords or phrases in user input and respond accordingly.

It’s a great beginner-friendly project to understand natural language processing basics and decision-making in Python.
